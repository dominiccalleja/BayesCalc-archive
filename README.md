As we expand our developer base we will add some communtiy rules. But for now, whilst the community is small we needen't worry. 

## TODO: 
-[FIXED] BUG ---- DONT KNOW method is returning weird answers

- Impliment generation of Question DB entry confusion matrix and history. Generation of ID, and forward processing. Maybe this would be better in JS? but harder to impliment. 
- Impliment timeline generator

## Repo ownership and acknowledgement
Dominic Calleja is the originator of this libary. Nick Gray and Alex Wimbush have helped in the development. 
But the original app is the work of Uchenna Oparaji, and Maria Fernandez, with the help of Luis Clearkin. 


## TODO History
Uchenna: Can you put an example script of how you run this app? [COMPLETE]

[COMPLETE]- add the functionality to generate a JS script. 
[COMPLETE]- add functionality to have 2 tiers of questions. Should run from something cleaver with the csv. Maybe grouped == 1 and a new class sub_question only invoked on a true at the previous tier.' 
[FIXED]- setting all to True is obvs wrong = 1.2 right now 
[FIXED]- BUG: seems there is a bug. there is a longer csv.index than number of questions. Need to check and figure out why
[COMPLETE]- check underlying pba funcitons [COMPLETE. Not using old version]

[COMPLETE]- get the icon array coded too.
