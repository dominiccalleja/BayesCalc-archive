TODO: 
- setting all to True is obvs wrong = 1.2 right now 

- BUG: seems there is a bug. there is a longer csv.index than number of questions. Need to check and figure out why

- check underlying pba funcitons
- add the functionality to generate a JS script. 
- add functionality to have 2 tiers of questions. Should run from something cleaver with the csv. Maybe grouped == 1 and a new class sub_question only invoked on a true at the previous tier.' 
- get the icon array coded too. 



As we expand our developer base we will add some communtiy rules. But for now, whilst the community is small we needen't worry. 
Dominic Calleja is the originator of this libary. But the original app is the work of Uchenna Oparaji, and Maria Fernandez, with the help of Luis Clearkin.
